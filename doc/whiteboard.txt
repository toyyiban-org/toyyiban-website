Rough Ideas
-----------
- Focus is on preservation of user data, not privacy/hiding sensitive data.


STATION (PLATFORM / APP / NODE)
-------------------------------
- A data service nodes connected to the netword.
- Station has it's own user block list, so it can follow local authority regulations.
- Each station keep PGP keys of all others it is connected too.
- Each station may choose who to connect with or all (compliant reasons).
- Station may choose entity types to support.
- To join network, new station need to register (send station.json and wait human approval)
with one available stations, if successful other stations will try to connect with it.
- No prime station, all are equal.


File: STATION.JSON - identity, config, moderation ruleset, etc.
- An important configuration file for every
- Shared between connected stations.


EVENT STORE
-----------
- Original event (JSON) received is optimized (image reduced to max size etc).
- Event encoded into CBOR (cbor-x for JS) before added to data buffer.
- Upon reaching size limit (50mb?) per rotation file, data buffer will be compressed using ZLIB and flush.


RELAY
-----
- Handle ping, gossip, requests between stations.
- Whenever someone spin up new station, they may run relay first to cache latest update and
then request a data-dump (starting from last entry in relay) from available stations.
- If cache in relay is update/delete/merge , then keep the cache for execution after dump finish loaded.


MODERATION
----------
- Moderation is independent of stations, however a station may send report to others to take action.



EVENT ACTION
------------
- Create, Replace, Merge, Delete


ENTITY
------
- Use improved ERI (Entity Resource Identifier) with station name. (eg: user@station.entity.value)
